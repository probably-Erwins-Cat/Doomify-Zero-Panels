A double-pane version of the popular Zero Panels for the Voron 0. This repo is a mashup of various Voron ideas:

- ZeroPanels: https://github.com/zruncho3d/ZeroPanels
- ZP for Stock Voron 0: https://github.com/adooze/ZeroPanels_for_Stock_V0.2
- Pandora Gantry: https://github.com/MasturMynd/Pandora
- DoomMini from the DOOM-Cube Discord channel.
- 
The Doomify-Zero panels are nearly all print-in-place; only hinged parts benefit from supports (or outstanding cooling) and the integrated spool holder part.

# Higher Chamber Temperatures and shorter Warm-up
The purpose is to provide easier access to double-pane Voron 0 without significantly overhauling the printer. Double-pane windows offer an ideal insulation layer and, thus, higher chamber temperatures and/or shorter warm-up times. This mod harmonizes well with bed fans and carbon filters. All you need is a second set of acrylic panels, a roll of VHB and foam tape. The Installation is virtually identical to the original Zero Panels, but you have to sandwich your second panel between the parts.

## Minimal Doomify-Zero-Panels
A second set of transparent panels for front, side, and top are sufficient for a minimal setup. In this case, the chamber is insulated in all directions except the back and lower electronic departments. Those should be adequately cooled since they will get warmer than usual with this mod! Further, take some foam tape to seal some gaps from the chamber to the electronics bays: (1) left and right side around the alu beams and the panels, (2) edge of the black back panel separating chamber and back electronics bay, and (3) behind the AB mounts, where the umbilical frame PCB rests.

## (Optional, but recommended) Insulation for the bottom electronics bay
The compartment with the PSU can be easily insulated from the chamber by taping a cut-to-size piece of cork mat (6-8mm) to the bottom panel. Cork is an excellent insulator, by the way.

## (Optional) Insulation of the back electronics bay
You can also double-pane this with a second (black) back panel. However, installation is a little bit trickier, and there is not much room due to the motor mount (relatively small insulating air gap). First, you have to remove all electronics from the bay. You would have to replace all M3 screws that hold your current in place, piece-by-piece, with short M3 standoffs and washers. Then you can screw the second panel onto the M3-Standoffs. Now, you can put all electronics back in. Is this worth the effort versus simply removing the electronics, taping down some more cork mats, and placing the electronics back in? I am still unsure, but this never stopped people from doing things. In any case, the electronics department should be well-ventilated when working with higher chamber temperatures. One popular mod is to drill some holes in the back panel and place a fan there.
